## What it does

PocketMC is a Windows desktop app for creating and managing Minecraft server instances — Java and Bedrock — without touching a command line. Java is bundled automatically. Public sharing is one click via Playit.gg.

Supported server types: **Vanilla · Paper · Fabric · Forge · Bedrock (BDS) · PocketMine-MP**

---

## Features

- **Managed runtimes** — PocketMC downloads and isolates its own JRE and PHP. Nothing touches your system.
- **Multi-instance** — Run multiple servers side-by-side with isolated folders and configs.
- **Live metrics** — CPU, RAM, and player count per instance, updated in real time.
- **Public tunneling** — Playit.gg integration with guided first-time setup. Public address shown as a copyable link on the dashboard.
- **Console** — Colorized logs, search, filtering, crash visibility, and command input in one panel.
- **Plugins, mods, and worlds** — Browse and install from supported sources. Import worlds from ZIP. Poggit integration for PocketMine plugins.
- **Backups** — Manual and scheduled backups with restore workflows and retention control.
- **AI session summaries** — Optional structured summaries of server sessions via external AI providers.

---

## Installation

Download `Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/PocketMC/pocket-mc-windows/releases/latest) and run it.

- No admin rights required — installs per-user.
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime is prompted automatically if missing.
- Java does **not** need to be pre-installed. PocketMC manages its own JRE stack.
- Updates are handled automatically via Velopack.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Pick a root folder** on first launch. Everything — servers, runtimes, tunnel — lives here.

**2. Create an instance.** Hit **New Instance**, choose a server type and version, accept the EULA, click **Create & Download**. The JAR fetches automatically.

**3. Start your server.** Hit **Start**. Metrics go live. Connect from Minecraft at `localhost` or your LAN IP.

**Optional: Enable public access.** Open the instance, enable Playit.gg tunneling, and follow the one-time account link flow. Your public address appears on the dashboard.
